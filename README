unfolding_app_template and UC San Diego/Coursera MOOC starter code
==================================================================
2020/09/10
This is my course work for the Coursera course "Object Oriented Programming in Java".

There are two main parts of work in this repository:
1. Finished all the assignment requirements from module1 to model6. Knowledge that has been covered 
includes:
    (1) Creating GUIs and Displaying Data;
    (2) Important concepts in Object Oriented Programming: Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.;
    (3) GUIs: Responding to User Events;
    (4) Basic sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort.
2. Work on (ongoing) my own extension to the package to add more functionalities, 
which includes:
    (1) When drag the mouse, it will select a rectangle region;
    (2) A rectangle will be drawn on the map;
    (3) And the summary information of Earthquake within the selected region will pop up in 
        a box, which will give the total number of the Earthquake, largest Earthquake info, 
        smallest Earthquake info. 
==================================================================
This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java course offered by 
UC San Diego through Coursera.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments
associated with the MOOC.

Get excited and make things!


INSTALLATION

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')


MANUAL INSTALLATION

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


TROUBLE SHOOTING

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
